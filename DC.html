        <h2>History</h2>
        <h4>Delhi team was bought by the property development company GMR Group for US$84 million.[5]

            In March 2018, GMR sold a 50% stake in the Delhi Daredevils to JSW Sports for ₹550 crore (US$77 million).[6]
            
            In December 2018, the team changed its name from the Delhi Daredevils to the Delhi Capitals.[7] Speaking to the rationale behind changing the team's name, co-owner and chairman Parth Jindal said, "Delhi is the power centre of the country, it is the capital, therefore the name Delhi Capitals."[8] Co-owner Kiran Kumar Grandhi said, "The new name symbolizes Delhi’s identity and just like the city, we are aiming to be the centre of all action going forward."[9]</h4>
        <h2>Background
            <h4><p>The Delhi Daredevils launched their new anthem "Munday Dilli Ke" ("The Lads from Delhi") on 5 March 2012 on YouTube.[34]

                Their anthem for the 2016 season of IPL, titled "Dhuandaar Dilli" was released on YouTube, sung by Sukhwinder Singh.[35] In 2018, they released yet another theme song, titled "Dil Dilli hai, ab Dhadkega".
