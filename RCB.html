        <h2>History</h2>
        <h4>The Royal Challengers have never won the IPL but finished runners-up on three occasions between 2009 and 2016. Their lack of success over the years despite the presence of various notable players has earned them the tag of "underachievers".[2][3] The team holds the records of both the highest and the lowest totals in the IPL – 263/5 and 49 respectively.</h4>
        <h2>Background
            <h4><p>The Bangalore franchise was purchased by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6 million for it. This was the second highest bid for a team, next only to Reliance Industries' bid of US$111.9 million for the Mumbai Indians.

                The brand value of Royal Challengers Bangalore was estimated to be ₹595 crore (US$83 million) in 2019, according to a survey conducted by Duff & Phelps.[5]</p>
