    <h4>
        <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league, contested by eight teams based out
            of eight different Indian cities.[3] The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India
            (BCCI) in 2007. It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the
            ICC Future Tours Programme.</p>
        <p>The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance
            among all sports leagues.[5] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast
            live on YouTube.[6][7] The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to
            Duff & Phelps.[8] According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the
            GDP of the Indian economy.</p>
        <p>There have been thirteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Mumbai Indians,
            who won the 2020 season.[10] The venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and games
            were played in the United Arab Emirates</p>

    <h4>On 13 September 2007, the BCCI announced the launch of a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called
        Indian Premier League whose first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New
        Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, said to be the mastermind behind the idea of the IPL, spelled out the
        details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition
        rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India
        players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League
        Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL was not
        started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[17] The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League
        of England and the NBA in the United States.[16]</h4>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <h4>The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[13]
        The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket
        Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[14] To
        prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments and
        also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board</h4>
