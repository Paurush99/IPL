        <h2><em>BCCI</em></h2>
        <h4> <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the governing body for cricket in India and is under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India.[2] The board was formed in December 1928 as a society, registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act.</p>
            <p>It is a consortium of state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who in turn elect the BCCI Chief. Its headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. Grant Govan was its first president and Anthony De Mello its first secretary.</p>
            <p>There have been thirteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holders are the Mumbai Indians, who won the 2020 season.[10] The venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and games were played in the United Arab Emirates</p></h4>
            <p><h4> In December 1928, the BCCI was registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act with six associations affiliated to it. R E Grant Govan was elected as its first president and Anthony de Mello as secretary.[4] Indian cricket team toured England in 1932.</h4></p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <h4>BCCI does not depend on the Government of India for its finances.[12]

            In 2020, with US$405 million out of US$1,534 million, India had 26% share in the ICC FTP income disbursed to 10 Test playing nations, while ECB received US$139 million as the second highest earner.[13]
            
            In 2020, to revive the financial health of other boards after the global economic decline and the significantly reduced income of most boards due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ICC will rejig its FTP to schedule more bilateral matches of others nations with India</h4>
