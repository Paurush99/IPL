        <h2>History</h2>
        <h4>The Mumbai franchise was sold to the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for $111.9 million, making it the most expensive team to be sold in the league.[11] RIL, owned by Mukesh Ambani acquired the rights to the franchise for a period of 10 years. Initially, the team decided to name the franchise as Mumbai Razors but as Sachin Tendulkar advised with Indians instead of Razors, the franchise was eventually named as "Mumbai Indians".</h4>
